JNTROD UCTJON xvii

1. At the diaeresis or caesura of a verse, eg. vv. 71, 171, 433,
459, 461, 605-

2. At a change of speakers or a marked pause in the sense,
e.g. vv. 90, 137, 147, 221, 270, 435.

3. After monosyllables ending in a long vowel, diphthong,
or -m, the said monosyllable being scanned as short, e.g. vv. 91,
104, 137, 232, 320, 580, 741, 754-

4. When two vowels of the same character come together,
vv· 459, 587, 648.- 671·

5. After an iambic word, eg. vv. 71, 344.

Exceptional cases also occur as in vv. 180, 576, 731.

§ss Length by position is not given to a vowel before a
consonant followed by ν or l.

58. In the time of Plautus many vowels of final syllables
retained either regularly or occasionally the original long quan-
tity which they afterwards lost. ι

Eg. the final —a of z'ta, of the nominative and accusative
neuter plural of nouns as (φρίιίιῖ, omnic& the final -e of the
ablative of the consonantal declension (note cnm luci v. 364, de
uesperi, Mil. 4. 2. 5), as Pers. 1. 1. 43, premia& the termination
-ᾱν of the passive first person singular future and subjunctive,
the termination -z‘t of the third person singular perfect indicative
active, e.g. optzgz‘l, v. 3843 -z't of the third person singular
present indicative active of the fourth conjugation, and of fierz';
the third person singular active terminations -czt, —et (the quantity
of sciat, v. 296, is doubtful); the first person singular present
indicative passive of the first conjugation3 and the nominative
of nouns of which the genitive is -o'm's exhibit -br, see v. 147.

’ 111 Plautus es from sum is a long syllable, see v. 363. Perhaps

the nominative -es of nouns which have the genitive ending in
-itz's, i‘dz's, as hospes, miles, diues, obses, praeses, had the e long
down to at least the middle of the second century B.C.

On the other hand we find ne frustrc'z‘ sis, and the nomina-
tives τ’ίίῖε, z'sti‘c regularly, and sometimes lffc.

ξ 9. Plautus is much addicted to alliteration of all kinds
and is not averse to rhyme. See vv. 12, 13, 31, 32 (rhyme), 45, 77,

85, 144, 150, 151 (rhyme), 206, 495 (rhyme).
