viii JNTROD UCTJON

There is not much that is distinctive about the brothers Epi· Ι
gnomus and Pamphilippus‚ buta few delicate touches show us
that Pamphilippus has a more generous disposition than his
brother. The perverse and impertinent Pinacium is doubtless
an accurate specimen of the privileged slave, and Crocotium of
the pert and flippant (slave) waiting-maid. Stichus is an unin-
teresting character, possibly because he is a type, as also no
doubt are the other slaves, Sagarinus and Stephanium.

ANALYSIS.

Antipho, an elderly, well—to-do citizen of Athens, wishes his
two daughters, Philumena and Pamphila, to give up their re-
spective husbands, Epignomus and Pamphilippus‚ who having
become impoverished have left Athens to seek their fortunes
and have not been heard of for more than two years, so that
they may marry wealthy men.

ACT Ι.

Scene Ι. Interior of Philumena⁷s (Epignomus’) house.
Philumena and her younger sister Pamphila enter from the
back part of the house. They discuss their husbands' absence
and their father's wish that they should marry again. The first
47 lines, though a dialogue, are ranked as a canticum, owing to
the kind and variety of metres.

Scene ΙΙ. Before Philumena’s house. Emer Antipho from
the spectators' right with a slave in attendance. He grumbles
at his slaves for ten lines, and then dismisses his slave. While
Antipho looks after the receding slave, his daughters speak
from the house as to how they can best get their own way with
him. Then Antipho in a soliloquy of thirteen lines decides
upon the best way of managing his daughters, stating that he
will let thern have their own way to avoid a fuss if they are firm.
Then his daughters see him and come out of the house. The
three converse outside. At the end of the scene Antipho retires
and then Pamphila, whereupon Philumena suinmons her female

slave Crocotium to fetch the parasite Gelasimus, that he may go
to the port for news.
