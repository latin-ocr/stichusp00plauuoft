and Pamphilippus, probably from the left. They talk of the
dinner which they are going to partake of at Epignomus’ house.
'fhen Epignomus enters from the central door, and after saluta-
tions Antipho points his moral that ‘fortune brings friends⁷ by
begging a female musician of Epignomus. He then enters
the house through the centra] door of the stage. Hereupon the
brothers see Gelasimus approaching.

Scene II. The scene is unchanged. Epignomus and Pam-
philippus are on the stage. To them enters Gelasimus. The

ACT V.

This act is devoted to the preparations for Stichus' feast with
Pamphilippus’ two slaves and to the feast itself‚ at the close os
which the three slaves clance to the music of a tibicen, whom
