metrical ictus in the shortening‚ and that there are about seven
instances of shortening ln‘c, llaec, hoc, hunc, lmnc, ltine, leuc after
another monosyllable. Also in the following instances words
which seem to bear the verbal accent get shortenetl: tamfftsz' (41),
sibi Esse (125), which is not a certain case, as sibi and tibi are
sometimes completely elideri, st'mzilque (306, 347), sbt &ccum
(527), perinde (520), m'dffllrct (555, 557). ublinlcrffilo), se't {nterim
(704), rige 5730 ops· (725), me, illic, intro, 2⁹ss8, and mic. N early
all the resolved theses in Plautus which exhibit shortening of a
long syllable begin with the beginning os a word. In v. 576
perhaps ne' quid ιῖιίη- should be written. Most of the exceptions
:ire cretic words such as npetu] imperd, maxumff, pessumi,
‹siquidm- but we fmd pc‘rque σόωίνπίίίιιυι, Capi, 2. Ι. 5 3.

The syllables which—not being the final syllable of a dis-
syllabic word or the second of two consecutive monosyllabic
words—are abnormally shortened in Plautus according to the
rule given and illustrated above may be classified as follows:

1. Those with short vowels before m, n, l, ν and another
consonant, especially just after a preposition as e'nfmuero, ne'c
adamate, a'd facilus, se't i‘nterz'm, sz'mzZlqzce, Ilipam in s-‚ dge
ffrgoe also ἴηίίε, nempe, finde. Perhaps the vowel and the nasal
or liquid coalesce into a sonant.

2. Those with short vowels before a double consonant, as
chum, cauillationes 1, supesslleclz'lzk, dnnonam, nicia-satim, esse, ille,
Philippos.

3. Those with short vowels followed by a consonantal sound
combined with a sibilant as zia-or, tamfflsz', ἔχ, citra 7552- (capt.
3. 4. 64), ministremus, ipsus, i‘ste, o'psomzb0, uetzZstate, scelffslusg
nzagffstralus.

4. Monosyllabic prepositions, in composition (as age dbdzzce,
zibz· dccubcs, dlimque se' exornat).

5. Syllables containing the stem vowel of the -ᾶ, -ἒ, and ῑ
conjugations, as uiddicet, κενέὂαυῑίιιί, imperti, reperi} amdbo.

Some apparent cases of shortening of a long syllable are
probably due to syncope, as uoluptas pronounced uolp'las, se-

1 This may be a case of synizesis.
