xvi JNTRODUCTJON

merlus pronounced scaelus. Such a pronunciation probably
began with and was most often applied to oblique cases of
uoluptas and seneclus (see vv. 532, 568).

In most of the cases in Plautus and Terence in which a long
syllable is scanned as a short syllable after a monosyllabic word,
the monosyllabic word is either qnid (interrogative), a personal
pronoun, sed, uel, or ut,—placed in approximate order of fre-
quency.

lt is probable that Plautus followed colloquial pronunciation
in his scansion.

ξ 3. Some arbitrary rules have been laid down as to the
prosody of Plautus which may be neglected. Eg. “The trochaie
caesura of a dactyl is forbidden, save in the first foot‚'' Yet
in v. 58 we find se'mcos lzem(o) in the fifth foot of a trochaic
tetrameter catalectic. Again we are told that gratiam, gratias,
silias, olio are only dissyllabic in anapaestic metres; but see
v. 71 and capt. 3. 5. 64, Ergo a‘b eo petilou istam gratiam. ddcz'te,
Trin. 4. 1. 2, 5, 19. Yet again we are told “An anapaest should
not be divided in iainbic οι· trochaic verse, so that its first
syllable is the last of a dissyllable or polysyllable, orso that its
two first syllables are the two last of a polysyllable.⁷' But see
v. 85 βέφῴίεχαόίίίίέν earnm hadde pe‘tpamfizciam pe'ctora, where
the third foot must be either -lcr cair· or -z'ser Vct-72, cf. v. 528.

It is not likely that in v. 625 hic is short before quidem, and
this remark is also applicable to iam before quidem v. 62.

ἓ 4. Plautus makes free use of synizesis and often treats i and
u as consonants, thus fusing two syllables into one. This process
is indicated throughout the text of this edition by italics. For
(aruit, v. 2 cf. fuit passim and crepuit, Aul. 4. 5. 5. The
converse process, of making iam a dissyllable after nunc, is
found vv. 115, 767, 774.

ἓ 5. Syncope, or the suppression of a short vowel when it is
between two consonants which can be conveniently pronounced
together, is used in Plautus more freely than in Classical Latin;
as alteri, altera pronounced altri, altra.

ἓὸ. Hiatus is freely admitted by Plautus, but not often
except in the following casesr—
