They generally occur in connected systems ending up with a
catalectic verse called a paroemiac‚ see vv. 30, 48, and occasion—
ally varied by a monometer. Two dimeters are often combined
into an acatalectic tetrameter, and these tetrameters, anapaestici
octonarii, sometimes form a system ending with a septenarius.

Anapaestic tetrameter catalectic verses, anapaestici septenarii,
admit spondees anci dactyls promiscuously, even dactyls before
anapaests.

Anapaestic dimeter catalectic verses occur consecutively
vv. 313—318, 322—325‚ th'e three intervening verses being
acatalectic dimeters. These catalectic dimeters consist of
spondees, one proceleusmatic, and one anapaest.

Bacchiae tetrameters admit 2nd and 4th paeons (νένν, νύν-χ
a molossus (—‡—), whence the Ionic a minori and a maiori
(vv‡—, —va) and choriambus (-·bv—). In vv. 43, 44 there are
two bacchii, three molossi, and three choriambi.

Latin dramatists and in particular by Plautus.

Final -s after a short i or u is frequently ignored in scansion,

syllabic thesis, and (B) a resolved arsisl which begins with the
beginning of a word, can have the second syllable irrational (a
long syllable instead of and scanned as a short syllable).

That is, an apparent bacchius or cretic can stand for a tro-
