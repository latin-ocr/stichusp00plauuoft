INTRODUCTION.

THE PLOT.

ΙΤ would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the Stichus
has no plot at all. Little of the interest would be lost if it were
divided up into three parts and the names of the characters
changed so as to give three disconnected sets of scenes. It is
probable that the play was originally divided into three acts, the
second, third, and fourth acts of editors forming one original
act. This would give 273 verses to the first original act, 367
verses to the second act, which began with the second canticum,
and 135 verses to the last act, which ends with a short canticum.
The comparative shortness of Act III. (Act V.) would be made
up for by there being in addition to the speeches a considerable
amount of business. There is no intrigue, no complication and
consequently no proper denouement or solution. But there is
plenty of interest, owing to the wit and humor of the various
sceneS. Several of the characters are types. The old man
Antipho is a fussy‚ selfish‚ easy-going man of the world. Even
his daughters, who disappear after the first act and are rather
colorless‚ are carefully sketched. Gelasimus, the parasite, who
is really the central figure of the piece, is a well-executed type of
his genus: hungry, greedy, impudent, spiteful and servile. He
takes part in scenes which occupy 360 verses, while the title
character only takes part in scenes which occupy 187 verses.
