after the fourth foot1. This metre is used for dialogue by Plautus
more than iambic senarii.

Trochaic tetrameter acatalectic verses, trochaici octonarii,
admit the tribrach (anapaest) as well as the spondee in the eighth
foot and dactyls and anapaests in the seventh3 but are in other
respects like septenarii. See Pers. 5. 1.

Iambic trimeter acatalectic verses, iambici senarii, admit in
all feet except the last, the spondee (especially in the fifth foot),
the dactyl less freely (not often in the fifth foot), the anapaest
(rarely in the third foot), the tribrach (very rarely in the fifth foot),
and the proceleusmatic occasionally in the first foot, very rarely
elsewhere, hardly ever if ever in the fifth foot. There is gene-
rally caesura in the third foot, less frequently in the fourth (as in
v. 55). Occasionally there is no caesura as in v. 227, acpc'rizcra-
lizinculas parasiticos. '

Iambic tetrameter catalectic verses, iambici septenarii or
comici quadrati, admit spondees freely, and anapaests, dactyls
and tribrachs in the first three feet and in the fifth, sixth, and
seventh feet, and occasional proceleusmatics (almost exclusively
in the o'dd places, mostly in the first and fifth). There is gene-
rally diaeresis after the fourth foot, the last syllable of which is
sometimes short, as if at the end of a verse. XVhen there is no
diaeresis there is generally caesura in the fifth foot.

Iambic tetrameter acatalectic verses, iambici octonarii, admit
iambies only in the eighth foot, and spondees almost always in
the seventh foot, while trisyllabic feet and proceleusmatics are
rare. When there is no diaeresis after the fourth foot (which is
most often an iambic), there is generally caesura in the fifth foot
as in vv. 279, 280.

Iambie dimeter acatalectic verses occur vv. 9—17, 34——36‚
and combined with catalectic tripodies vv. 3—8.

Anapaestic dimeter acatalectic verses admit spondees, dactyls
(especially in the odd places, but see vv. 19, 20) and proceleus-
matics occasionally in the odd (but see v. 21) places. They

² Such a verse as Quia ita meae animae' salsura ειιέιιίί - Adside lzz'c
pater is most common when diaeresis is absent.
