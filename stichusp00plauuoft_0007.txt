PREFACE.

THIS edition of a play, which contains much wit and
humor and comparatively little that is objectionable‚ is
intended for use at school or college.

The text is based on the apparatus criticus of Ritsehl,
but keeps more closely to the Mss. than any previous
edition. I have ventured on two original suggestions, namely
mussmzerz'm‚ v. 420, for the obviously corrupt mulcauerz'm of
MSS„ and esse, mei, v. 753, for ei miln‘.

My observations on prosody are mainly derived from the'
work of others3 but Ι have stated the rule for the ‘irrational'
use of long or apparently long syllables in an improved form,
and have made suggestions of my own upon other points.
