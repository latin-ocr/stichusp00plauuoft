INTROD UCTION xix

MANUSCRIPTS.

The chief authorities for the text of the Sliclms are the
following ῑ--Α, The Codex Ambrosianus (Milan), a palimpseSi.
The original writing consists of about two-thirds of the plays of
Plautus, and is probably as early as A-D. 550, but it is much
defficed, and has had a copy of the Vulgate written over it. For
the value of its readings, see Index under “Codex A.⁷⁷ They
are generally superior to those of other MSS„ where there is
difference ; but this superiority is not invariable, eg. v. 511, A
gives se apul se sor le aput se.

B. The Codex Vesus of Camerarius (vatican), 11th century.

C. The Codex Palatinus (Heidelberg), 12th century.

D. The Codan- Ursinianus (Vatican), 12th century.

F. The Codex Lipsiensis, 15th century, Leipzig, a manu-
script edition full of fifteenth century conjectures, which is
chiefly interesting as the basis of Z, the editio princeps (Venice,
1472), and os most early editions.

The Stichus is a. version by Plautus of Menander's Φιλά-
δελφοι. The scenes are laid at Athens. The play was produced
in Rome, in the consulship of P. Sulpicius Galbus Maximus
(ΙΙ.) and C. Aurelius Cotta, B.C. 200.
